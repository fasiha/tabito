    Here's a basic demo sentence I want to remember: <StaticSentence
      plain="うどんを食べた"
      docName={documentName}
    />
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    I didn't know this about たくさん: it can be used as an adverb and a noun
    and an adjective. This sentence can be shuffled around two ways, though only
    one will be visible: <StaticSentence
      docName={documentName}
      plain="京都でたくさん写真を撮りました"
    />
  </div>
  <div class="paragraph">
    Consider several sentences in one:
    <StaticSentence
      docName={documentName}
      plain="これは兄が予約した旅館です"
    />. Here are two sentences in one:
    <StaticSentence docName={documentName} plain="音が好き" />. And consider
    this:
    <StaticSentence docName={documentName} plain="死んじまえ" />
  </div>

    You can examine all the details we've attached to sentences: translations,
    dictionary definitions, verb and adjective conjugations, dependency chunks,
    etc. This is in the Sentence Details view.

    You can "learn" a sentence: this uses Tabito to practice sentences via
    Ebisu. This is in the Review section.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can add individual dictionary to practice as flashcards. You can also
    override the definition for the flashcard for each dictionary, and add
    custom mnemonics.
